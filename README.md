# Haro-Design
# Files for 3D printing a Haro frame, designed around electronic support for an arduino code. STL 3D print files are provided, along with the arduino code for running the following:

- Default Haro state: Regular blinking and sound response
- Flustered Haro State: Responds to being tilted and juttered with flustered blinking, sounds, and ear flapping
